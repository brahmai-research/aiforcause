Hello, we are [DEEPNIGHT](https://deepnight.tech), we are thrilled to introduce you to the **#aiforcause API**. We've got something special to share with the AI community.

## Our Mission

At DEEPNIGHT, we believe in pushing the boundaries of AI. We're on a mission to make AI accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial resources. We understand that not everyone can afford expensive AI services, and we're here to change that. With the #aiforcause API, you can access powerful AI tools to drive innovation, enhance your applications, and bring your ideas to life.

## What's the Deal?

We're providing the ChatGPT API for free! Yes, you read it rightâ€”absolutely free of cost. Our aim is to empower developers, innovators, and dreamers with the AI tools they need to build a brighter future. To get started, explore our user-friendly API, and see how it can elevate your projects and enable new possibilities in AI-driven innovation.

## Privacy Matters

Your privacy is important to us. That's why we've made sure our API comes with no strings attached. We won't ask for your personal information, track your usage, or log your data. We're in the business of providing AI, not collecting your info, so no data-stealing shenanigans here!

## How You Can Help

We're in this together, and we're counting on your support to keep this API free. If you find value in what we're offering, we'd greatly appreciate any contributions or donations you can make to help us sustain this mission. Your generosity will enable us to continue providing this service and expand our offerings, including adding more features and capabilities to the API.

## What's Available Now

We're starting with the GPT-3.5 4k API Endpoint, and it's just the beginning. With your support, we aim to bring you even more models, including the future GPT-4, unlocking a world of AI possibilities.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Rate Limit:** Unfortunately, the API does have a rate limit. The current rate limit is set to 240k tokens per minute and 1440 requests per minute.

- **Please use responsibly!** We are doing this for a good cause! Please use it for the same reason. This effort is not going to be worth a single penny if we end up revoking the endpoint. Your responsible usage ensures that this valuable resource remains available to all.

- **API Key:** To use the endpoint, simply change the OpenAI base_url to the above-mentioned endpoint. Mentioning the API Key is mandatory, so please just pass a random string instead (it's of no use in this case).

- **No Streaming Support:** It doesn't currently have streaming support, please don't use stream with this. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the API's usage, feel free to reach out to us at [hello@deepnight.tech](mailto:hello@deepnight.tech).

- **Response:** The response is going to be an OpenAI API response with just a couple of things masked. Rest everything is exactly the same!
